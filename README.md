# How to self-host the bot?

1. Delete node_modules (please do this if you want to self-host, it will not work if you try to use it with the stock node_modules)
2. in a terminal (such as lxterminal (linux) terminal.app (mac) or Windows Terminal or Command Prompt (Windows)) run "npm install" then wait (its okay for a MAJOR vulnerability to be found with the translate api [i think])
3. in that same terminal run "node main.js" or "node ./main.js" if you're on a Unix-based OS (Like MacOS or Linux)
